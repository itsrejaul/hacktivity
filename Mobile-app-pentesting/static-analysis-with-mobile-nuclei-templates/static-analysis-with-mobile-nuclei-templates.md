............................................

## Prerequisites

- **apktool** — for decompiling APKs.
- **Go (>=1.20)** — required to install Nuclei.
- **nuclei** — the template-based scanner.
- **mobile-nuclei-templates** — a collection of mobile security templates for Nuclei.

## Step-by-Step Usage

1. **Ensure apktool is installed** — used for APK decompilation.

2. **Install Nuclei:**

```
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest
```

**Explanation:** This command installs Nuclei using Go and saves the binary in your `GOPATH/bin` directory. To run `nuclei` globally, add this path to your system `PATH` using:

```
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Then you can simply run `nuclei` from any terminal.

3. **Download the Nuclei mobile templates:**

```
git clone https://github.com/optiv/mobile-nuclei-templates.git
```

**Explanation:** This clones a repository containing mobile security scanning templates for Nuclei.

4. **Download and decompile your target APK:**

```
apktool d apk_name.apk
```

**Explanation:** Decompiles the given APK into readable resources and smali files inside a new folder. Ensure you have proper permissions to write files.

5. **Run static testing with Nuclei templates:**

```
nuclei -target <decompile_apk_folder_name_here> -file /<your_path_where/downloads>/mobile-nuclei-templates
```

# You can use like this -

```
nuclei -target allsafe/ -file /home/kali/test/mobile-nuclei-templates
```

**Explanation:** Runs Nuclei using the provided templates to scan your decompiled app folder. You can also use `-t` (template path) and `-u file://<path>` for precise control.

> ⚠️ Note: Not every Nuclei response is a real bug. Treat them as hints — always verify manually before reporting.

## Manual Verification Checklist

- Review `AndroidManifest.xml` for dangerous permissions and exported components.
- Look for hardcoded credentials or API keys under `res/values/` or code.
- Identify insecure exported Activities, Services, or Content Providers.
- Check for missing encryption, weak configurations, or insecure data storage.

## Summary

- **What was done:** Decompiled an APK and performed static vulnerability scanning using Nuclei mobile templates.
- **Why:** Template-based scanning quickly reveals vulnerability hints and helps speed up manual review.
- **Limitation:** Static results may include false positives — always confirm through manual or dynamic testing.
