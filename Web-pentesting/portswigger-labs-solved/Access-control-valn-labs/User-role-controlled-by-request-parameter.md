## Lab-3: User role controlled by request parameter

# Question:

```
This lab has an admin panel at /admin, which identifies administrators using a forgeable cookie.

Solve the lab by accessing the admin panel and using it to delete the user carlos.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter
```

## Step to Produce

1. In the previous question we don't have any credentials to log-in and we don't know the admin panel endpoint also. But in this case we have admin panel and login credentials both. Interesting!
2. Let's login with the valid credentials. Use burpsuite for better understanding of all requests and responses.
3. After login with valid credentials I found an interesting cookies -

```
Cookie: session=Tc9jP0pNozaoJ7zh8YmswGThwP8sIrjJ; Admin=false
```

4. That means if I set Admin=false to Admin=true then I escalate to admin user and got the admin dashboard.
5. Lets tempering the cookie in your browser and find the _Admin Panel_ and delete the carlos user and complete your task.

--- THE END ---
