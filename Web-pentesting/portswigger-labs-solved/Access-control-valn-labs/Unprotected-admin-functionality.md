## Lab-1: Unprotected admin functionality

# Question:

```
This lab has an unprotected admin panel.

Solve the lab by deleting the user carlos.

```

## Step to Produce:

1. First access the lab and see the all functionality as a normal user. Our target is to find out the admin panel.
2. Then I decided to find out _robots.txt_ file. Sometimes developers send a message to the browser crawl that this endpoint is not for your crawling, skip this endpoint.
3. That's why we need to check _robots.txt_ file to find the admin endpoint or some high privilege endpoint.

```
https://<lab_url>/robots.txt
```

Now i can see this file -

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /administrator-panel
```

That means this is our unprotected target admin panel. Let's try to visit here -

4. Now we can see the _admin dashboard_ and now we can delete _carlos_ user from the admin dashboard and complete your task.

--- THE END ---
