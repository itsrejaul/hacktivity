## Lab-8: User ID controlled by request parameter with password disclosure

# Question:

```
This lab has user account page that contains the current user's existing password, prefilled in a masked input.
To solve the lab, retrieve the administrator's password, then use it to delete the user carlos.
You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter
```

## Step to Produce:

1. First I login with the given credentials and click on the “My Account” button and grep this request into burp. Now I can see a query perimeter here with current username values.
2. From the question hint we know that - we need to find out the “administrator” password. So, I change the query perimeter value with -

```
GET /my-account?id=administrator
```

3. After forwarding the request I can see the administrator password. We can see the password with “inspect” this page and we can get the password from burp.
4. Now we have administrator credentials -

```
Username: administrator
Password: 7bdgq91qbuezg206brfr
```

5. Now I login with this credentials and delete the user carlos and complete the task.

— THE END —
